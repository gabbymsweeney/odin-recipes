        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This simple, sensational marinade and sauce for grilled chicken is made with lemon, garlic, rosemary, and butter. Separate 
        the marinade into thirds: one third for marinating, one third for basting, and one third for topping. This recipe yields six 
        servings.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Pour one third of the 
            blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts with marinade. Place chicken breasts on a 
            platter, cover, and refrigerate for three hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and lemon 
            mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting mixture, about four minutes per side. An 
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken 
            breasts from the grill, and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture.</li>
        </ol>
